## Following are the analysed areas and their observations:

  * ### Economic Data:
     * **Adjusted net national income (annual % growth)** - 
            Adjusted net national income (annual % growth) measures the annual percentage growth rate of a country’s adjusted net national income (NNI). This metric provides a more comprehensive view of national income by accounting for the depreciation of fixed capital and the depletion of natural resources

         ***Observation*** - The Chinese Adjusted net national income increased rapidly from 2012 compared with rest of the countries.

     * **Adjusted net national income per capita** -
            Adjusted net national income per capita is a measure that reflects the average income per person in a country, adjusted for the depreciation of fixed capital and the depletion of natural resources. This metric provides a more accurate representation of sustainable income by accounting for the wear and tear on capital assets and the reduction of natural resources.

         ***Observation*** - Brazil and Russian average income per person reduced from 2013 and for the rest of the countires its slowly increasing over the years.

     * **Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added** -
            Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added refers to the net output of these sectors after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. This metric is crucial for understanding the economic contribution of these primary sectors to a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

         ***Observation*** - Russia has a lowest Economic contribution from Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing during 2010 and highest at 2011
